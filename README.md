# JavaScript Password Generator

This projects' goal is to help someone create a new and secure password. The password is determined by the user's input responses and then is generated in the box.

## Challenge Criteria Goals:

- Present a series of prompts for password criteria
- Allow the user to select which criteria to include in their password.
- Specifically ask if the user how long they would like their password to be.
- Allow the user to choose whether or not they would like special characters in their password.
- Allow the user to choose whether or not they would like lowercase letters in their password.
- Allow the user to choose whether or not they would like uppercase letters in their password.
- Allow the user to choose whether or not they would like numeric characters in their password.
- User input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- Lastly, when the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
